      <p className="introText">I love extreme sports because they are flashy and based on skills. For me programming is the same in it's core, skill is visible and it comes from invested time.</p>
      <p className="introText">I started my programming journey learning after work, after a year I realized that this is what I want to do to and joined a bootcamp to speed up the process. For now I am professionally a developer for over a year, mainly focusing on backend work with PHP. What haven't changed is that I still learn consistently after work either about more theoretical CS topics or game development.</p>
      <p className="introText">In work my mentality is that my main job is to produce the highest quality software compared to my abilities.</p>
